# React-Tailwind-Assignment---Greeting-Cards
The project, titled "Greeting Cards," involved building a responsive React application using Vite and Tailwind CSS. The application consists of three components:
Header, GreetingCard; and App.
The objective was to practice creating React functional components, passing props, and styling using Tailwind CSS. The final application showcased a header and multiple greeting cards with unique messages.

Through this project I was able to: understand and apply the process of setting up a React project using Vite; learn how to integrate Tailwind CSS for efficient and modern styling; build reusable functional components in React; and use props to dynamically pass data between components.
